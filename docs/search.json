Unlike mere SVG testing (spatially variable gene) involves testing spatial variation gene expression within group, wispack allows testing whether factor age rearing conditions nonzero effect spatial variation groups differing factor. Wispack performs testing first using change-point detection find spatial variation samples, fitting nonlinear mixed-effect model detected change points. core nonlinear model parameterization found change-points inflections logistic functions representing gradients gene expression change. Multiple change-points handled summing component logistic functions “poly-sigmoid” function. Fixed effects (age rearing conditions) modeled effects underlying logistic parameters. Random (within group) effects modeled nonlinear warping poly-sigmoid. Significance testing performed effects either bootstrapping MCMC resampling.
