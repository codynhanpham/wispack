\title{Plot individual components of wisp fit for a single child level}
\usage{
\method{plot}{decomposition}(wisp.results, child, log = FALSE, dim.boundaries = c(), y.lim = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{wisp.results}{List, output of the wisp function.}

\item{child}{Character string, the child level to plot. Must be provided, and only one at a time.}

\item{log}{Logical, if TRUE, plots on a log scale. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{dim.boundaries}{Numeric vector, independent block boundaries to plot for comparison. If empty, the argument is ignored.}

\item{y.lim}{Numeric vector of length 2, limits for the y-axis of the plots. If NA, defaults to automatic limits.}
}
\value{
List of ggplot objects containing the decomposed rate-count plots.
}
\description{
Extension of \code{plot.ratecount} which plots the individual pieces of the rate-count plot for a single child separately. Returns individual plots for data points only, fit lines only, and data points plus fit lines for individual random levels.
