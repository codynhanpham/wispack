\title{Make plot demonstrating how the wisp function is determined by the Rt, slope, and tpoint parameters}
\usage{
demo_sigmoid(
  r = 4,
  s = 1,
  Rt = c(6, 3, 0.2, 6) * 4.65,
  tslope = c(0.4, 0.75, 1),
  tpoint = c(15, 38, 80)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{Numeric, upper asymptote for logistic (must be a single value).}

\item{s}{Numeric, slope scalar at inflection point (must be a single value).}

\item{Rt}{Numeric vector, rate parameters for the wisp function. Degree of the wisp model will be length of this vector minus 1.}

\item{tslope}{Numeric vector, slope scalars for the wisp function. Must be one less than the length of Rt.}

\item{tpoint}{Numeric vector, transition points for the wisp function. Must be one less than the length of Rt.}
}
\value{
Nothing. A ggplot object is printed to console.
}
\description{
This function takes user-provided values for wisp function parameters and produces a panel of plots showing how the wisp model is determined by the Rt, slope, and tpoint parameters.
