\title{Make plot demonstrating how the wisp function is warped by the warping factors}
\usage{
demo_warp(
  w = 2,
  point_pos = 60,
  point_neg = 40,
  Rt = c(6, 3, 0.2, 6) * 4.65,
  tslope = c(0.4, 0.75, 1),
  tpoint = c(15, 38, 80),
  w_factors = c(0.6, -0.9, 0.5)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{Numeric, warping factor (must be a single value).}

\item{point_pos}{Numeric, x coordinate at which to place positive warp segment (must be a single value).}

\item{point_neg}{Numeric, x coordinate at which to place negative warp segment (must be a single value).}

\item{Rt}{Numeric vector, rate parameters for the wisp function. Degree of the wisp model will be length of this vector minus 1.}

\item{tslope}{Numeric vector, slope scalars for the wisp function. Must be one less than the length of Rt.}

\item{tpoint}{Numeric vector, transition points for the wisp function. Must be one less than the length of Rt.}

\item{w_factors}{Numeric vector, warping factors for the wisp function. Must be length 3. First element is the warping factor for Rt, second for tslope, and third for tpoint. Note that this is more restrictive than the real wisp model, which not only allows for different warping factors across the model components (Rt, tslope, and tpoint), but also across the different elements within each model component as well.}
}
\value{
Nothing. A ggplot object is printed to console.
}
\description{
This function takes user-provided values for wisp function parameters and produces a panel of plots showing how the wisp model is warped by the warping factors
